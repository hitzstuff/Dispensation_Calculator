A simple calculator to quickly tally up dispensation amounts.

Depending on the state, tallying up amounts to dispense at a medical marijuana dispensary can be time-consuming.
Beyond convenience, errors in dispensation can have negative effects for both the patient and the dispensary.
This tool aims to solve both of those issues.

DIRECTIONS:

Run the shortcut inside the 'Dispensation Calculator' folder.  Alternatively, directly open the executable file from the /dist/ folder.
